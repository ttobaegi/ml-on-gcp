#### `tf.transform` 


- Implement feature preprocessing and feature creation / Carry out feature processing efficiently, at scale and on streaming data.
- Define preprocessing pipelines and run these using large scale data processing frameworks, while also exporting the pipeline in a way that can be run as part of a TensorFlow graph.

> -   _Preproccess data and engineer new features using `Tf.Transform`_
> -   _Create and deploy **Apache Beam** pipeline_
> -   _Use processed data to train taxifare model locally then serve a prediction_
