# _5.	Feature Engineering_


## _5-8. Exploring tf.transform_

`tf.transform` to define preprocessing pipelines and run these using large scale data processing frameworks, while also exporting the pipeline in a way that can be run as part of a TensorFlow graph.

> -   _Preproccess data and engineer new features using `Tf.Transform`_
> -   _Create and deploy **Apache Beam** pipeline_
> -   _Use processed data to train taxifare model locally then serve a prediction_
